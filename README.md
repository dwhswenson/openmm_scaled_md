Scaled MD implementation in OpenMM.

## Installation

1. Install OpenMM. In general we recommend using `conda`, in which case the
   installation is just `conda install -c omnia openmm`.

2. Install [openmmtools](http://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools).

3. Install this package. Download the code, change to the main directory
   (with the file `setup.py`) and type `pip install .`, or, if you want an
   editable install, `pip install -e .`.
